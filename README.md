# Conceal

Conceal is an [Atom][] package that conceals text and replaces it with prettier
alternatives.

To configure Conceal, set the `replacements` option in your config. You can also
configure Conceal to only run for particular languages by setting `grammars`.

``` cson
# config.cson
"*":
  conceal:
    replacements:
      ".": "âˆ˜"
    grammars: [
      "Haskell"
    ]
```
